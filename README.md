# GAS (AT&amp;T) assembly syntax highlighting for Notepad++.

This is a Notepad++ highlighting file for the syntax used by GNU Assembler (GAS) and GCC. Sometimes it's called "AT&T" syntax due to historical reasons.
 
## How to install

1. Download a .xml file 
2. Open Notepad++. 
3. Select "Language" at the top, then "Define your language..." and click "Import". Open the .xml file you've downloaded.
4. Restart editor. 

## Other notes

* Please note that the default assembly file extension for GAS/GCC is ``.s``, not ``.asm``.
* Feel free to contribute any changes, as the keyword list is far from complete.
